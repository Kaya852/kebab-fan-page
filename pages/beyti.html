            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The dish is named after Beyti Güler, the owner of the popular restaurant Beyti in Istanbul. He was inspired to create his own dish in 1961 after witnessing Swiss butcher Möller's method of preparing meat, when he was visiting Switzerland. His version consists of lamb fillets wrapped in strips of cutlet fat, and grilled. The dish of ground meat commonly sold as street food under this name, bears little resemblance to his original.</p>
